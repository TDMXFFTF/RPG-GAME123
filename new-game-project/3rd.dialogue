	Kayle: Hello there
	- Hi!
		Kayle: I heard you're looking for the final key.
		- Yes! What do you need me to do?
			Kayle: That monster in the cave is going to tear you up, and I don't want you dying in the cave, So I've created a trial for you to see if you are ready!
			Kayle: If you complete it, you are worthy enough of this key. How does that sound?
			- I'm ready!
				Kayle: Perfect lets get started!
				set State.state_quest = "start3"
				set State.func_call = "change_to_quest3"
			- Let me think about it
				Kayle: uhhh ok

	Kayle: Welcome back. What would you like to know?
	 - Can I do the trial again?
		Kayle: Sure why not. It will be much more difficult, but if you complete this one, I'll give you the best sword there is.
		- Say less
			Kayle: Perfect lets get moving!
			set State.state_quest = "start4"
			set State.func_call = "change_to_quest4"
		- Ok maybe not
			Kayle: You can always change your mind
	 -  Who lives in the cave?
		Kayle: The great "monster" lives in that cave. It's not really a monster, but it does hate new visitors. Last visitor got eaten up the moment they stepped foot into the forest.

	Kayle: I have nothing more to give you, it is now up to you to enter the cave and defeat the monster.
